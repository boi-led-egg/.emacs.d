    M-m - Moves the cursor to the true beginning of a line, in other words it moves the cursor to the indentation or to the first character ignoring the white space.
    M-<,M-> Jumps to the beginning and end of the buffer. Keep in mind that a mark is set before the jump takes place.
    C-v, M-v Moves the cursor a up a page or down a page, useful for faster vertical movement for file scanning.
    M-g M-g Moves the cursor to the specified line number. You can also prefix this command to avoid the mini buffer prompt. (We'll cover prefixing commands later)
    C-l Will cycle the cursors line between the center, top and bottom of the current window's view port.
    M-r Will cycle the cursor position between the center, top and bottom of the current windows view port.
	we can move the cursor to an outer block, using C-M-u (think of it as, up)
